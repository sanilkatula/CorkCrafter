# CorkCrafter: Red Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview
CorkCrafter is a SingleStore notebook-based tool designed to predict the quality of red wine. Utilizing a Random Forest machine learning model, this tool offers both insightful analyses and interactive predictions. It's aimed at wine enthusiasts, producers, and data scientists interested in the intersection of oenology and machine learning.

## Features
- **Red Wine Quality Prediction**: Leverages a Random Forest model to predict the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties.
- **Custom Prediction Function**: A tailored function that takes specific wine parameters and predicts its quality.
- **Interactive Wine Quality Predictor**: A user-friendly interface for making real-time predictions.

## How It Works
- The notebook begins with an introduction to the problem statement and the approach used.
- It then walks through the process of using a Random Forest model for predicting wine quality.
- An interactive section allows users to input wine characteristics and receive a quality prediction.

## Getting Started
To use CorkCrafter, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Download the CorkCrafter notebook.
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter to access the features.
